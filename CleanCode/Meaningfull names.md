# Meaningful Names

## Clarity is a King!

1. **Names Should Reveal Intent**
    - The name of a variable, class, or function should answer the question of why it exists.
    - Code should be implicit, making it easy to read and understand.
    
2. **Avoid Disinformation**
    - Avoid words whose entrenched meaning varies from the intended one.
    - Avoid names that vary in small ways.
    
3. **Make Meaningful Distinctions**
    - Number series naming (e.g., `a1`, `a2`, `a3` ...) is BAD naming.
    - Avoid noise words (unmeaningful names). Noise words are redundant.
    
4. **Use Pronounceable Names**
    
5. **Use Searchable Names**
    - The length of the name should correspond to the size of its scope. Single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods.
    - If a variable or constant is used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name (define a constant).
    
6. **Avoid Preceding 'I' in Interface Names**
    
7. **Avoid Mental Mapping**
    - `i`, `j`, `k` serve for loops (and that's all!). You should use better naming for your variables, not single letters.
    
8. **Classes and Objects Should Have Noun or Noun Phrase Names**
    
9. **Method Names Should Have Verb or Verb Phrase Names**
    
10. **Accessors, Mutators, and Predicates Should Be Named for Their Value and Prefixed with `get`, `set`, and `is`**
    
11. **Don't Use Slang or Local Meanings. Say What You Mean**
    
12. **Use Consistent Lexicon for Code Naming**
    - Always give names in the same way.
    
13. **Add Meaningful Context**
    - Group variables in a class, etc.
    
14. **Don't Add Extra Context**
    - Do not prefix all variables with the project name.
    
15. **Don't Be Afraid to Refactor**
