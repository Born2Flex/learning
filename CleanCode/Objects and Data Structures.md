# Objects and Data Structures

1. **Hiding Implementation**    
    - Hiding implementation is about forming abstractions.
    
2. **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Code**
    - Procedural code makes it hard to add new structures (new implementations) because all the functions must change.
    - Object-oriented code makes it hard to add new functions because all classes must change.
    
3. **Law of Demeter**
    - A module should not know about the innards of the object it manipulates (hide data, expose operations).
